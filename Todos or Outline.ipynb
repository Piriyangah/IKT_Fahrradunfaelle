    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **Understand the Datasets**\n",
    "- [ ] **Define the problem**\n",
    "   - Objective: Predict whether a given situation (defined by features such as time, location, weather, etc.) is likely to result in a bicycle accident.\n",
    "   - Output: A binary classification where 1 indicates a high likelihood of an accident and 0 indicates a low likelihood (which could include near misses or safe conditions).\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] **Data Preparation**\n",
    "   - Combine the Datasets: merge the datasets and add an extra column to indicate whether the incident was an accident (1) or near miss (0)\n",
    "     - the column could be called 'accident likelihood etc'\n",
    "     - **Maybe rename some columns** e.g\n",
    "       - **The i1 - i9 in near accidents could be renamed similarly to actual accidents. e.g i7 = ist PKW etc**\n",
